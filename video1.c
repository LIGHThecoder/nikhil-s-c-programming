/*C is one of the fastest programming language as it is close to low level language such as assembly language.
C was developed in early 1970's but is is still in much demand and it doesn't seem it is going anywhere, there are a lot of reasons for that such as
C gives most of the control in the hand of users. things like memory allocation and manipulation are totally in the hands of the programmer. being a flexible language, it provides more access to the programmer because of which it is more efficient. All of these reasons make C one of the widely used promgramming language having speical respect in the heart of programmers.
