/*do while loop
while loop
for loop


**A loop is a way of repeating a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. There are three types of loops in C programming: while loop, do while loop, and for loop. Here is a simple explanation of each loop:

_________ while loop__________ checks the condition before executing the code inside the loop. It repeats the code as long as the condition is true. For example, while (x < 10) { printf(“%d\n”, x); x++; } This loop prints the numbers from 0 to 9, as long as x is less than 10.
_________ do while loop ______________executes the code inside the loop at least once, and then checks the condition. It repeats the code as long as the condition is true. For example, do { printf(“%d\n”, x); x++; } while (x < 10); This loop also prints the numbers from 0 to 9, but it does not check the condition until after the first iteration.
__________ for loop______________ combines the initialization, condition, and update of a loop variable in one statement. It executes the code inside the loop as long as the condition is true. For example, for (x = 0; x < 10; x++) { printf(“%d\n”, x); } This loop also prints the numbers from 0 to 9, but it uses a for loop to control the value of x*/

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("xxx");
return 0;
